## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **Auto-Update:** Implemented a robust in-app update mechanism with a custom UI overlay, powered by the Tauri Updater plugin and GitHub Releases. Supports automatic checking, downloading, and restarting the application.

### Changed

## [0.2.3-beta.2] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed

- **Auto-Update:** Resolved signature verification errors by properly passing the private key password to the bundler in the CI/CD pipeline.
